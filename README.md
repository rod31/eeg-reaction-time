# EEG Reaction Time Prediction

## 🧠 Overview
This project uses EEG recordings to classify cognitive reaction times (fast vs. slow) during closed-loop neurocognitive tasks. The goal is to extract meaningful brainwave features and evaluate their predictive power using traditional machine learning methods.

## 🧪 Methods
- Extracted epoch-level features from EEG data using MATLAB and the EEGLAB toolbox.
- Engineered theta and alpha band power metrics for classification.
- Trained and evaluated a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using k-fold cross-validation.
- Visualized model performance using confusion matrix and decision boundary plots.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **MATLAB** + **EEGLAB** for signal processing
- **Python (scikit-learn, matplotlib)** for ML pipeline
- **SVM** for classification of reaction speed categories

## 📊 Results
- Achieved promising classification accuracy distinguishing fast vs. slow responses
- Highlighted the role of theta and alpha wave power in attention modulation

## 📁 Repo Contents
- `scripts/` — (optional) MATLAB or Python scripts used for analysis
- `docs/` — Visualizations and figures (add confusion matrix, brainwave plots, etc.)
- `README.md` — This file

## 🧠 Background
Developed as part of undergraduate research at the Cognitive Neuroengineering and Wellbeing Lab (Drexel University), studying the relationship between EEG features and attentional performance.
